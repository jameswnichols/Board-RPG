# Board RPG
A 2D randomly-generated game made for my Year 1 Semester 1 programming project.

Features:
- Has an island map which changes each time you play.
- ???

Restrictions:
- Only allowed to have one `main` file.
- Not allowed to use `continue`, `break` or `pass`.
- Not allowed to use `class` - no object orientation allowed.
- Not allowed to use `global` - for the best.
- Not allowed `while` loops that don't have a terminating condition.
- Can only make functions that modify the `state` variable, can't modify it outside of them.
- Must contain a `main()` function.
- Must contain a `show_board()` function that **doesn't** change `state`.
