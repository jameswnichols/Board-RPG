# Board RPG
A 2D randomly-generated game made for my Year 1 Semester 1 programming project.

Features:
- Has an island map which changes each time you play.
- ???

Commands (Optional arguments start with `+`'s):
- `show` > `board` | `inv` / `inventory`, `+page`
- `move` > `f` / `for` / `forwards` | `b` / `back` | `l` / `left` | `r` / `right`, `+steps`

Restrictions:
- Only allowed to have one `main` file.
- Not allowed to use `continue`, `break`, `class`, `global` or `pass`.
- Not allowed `while` loops that don't have a terminating condition.
- Can only make functions that modify the `state` variable, can't modify it outside of them.
- Must contain a `main()` function.
- Must contain a `show_board()` function that **doesn't** change `state`.
